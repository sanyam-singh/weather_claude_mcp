Bihar AgMCP - Claude Desktop Integration Guide
Overview

Bihar AgMCP (Agricultural Model Control Protocol) is a specialized MCP server that integrates with Claude Desktop to provide AI-powered agricultural weather alerts for Bihar, India. This integration allows Claude to access real-time weather data, crop information, and generate personalized farming recommendations directly within the Claude Desktop interface.

What is MCP (Model Control Protocol)?

MCP is a protocol that allows AI assistants like Claude to connect to external tools and data sources. In this case, the Bihar AgMCP server acts as a bridge between Claude and agricultural data systems, enabling Claude to:

Generate location-specific weather alerts

Provide crop-specific recommendations

Access Bihar district and village data

Create multi-channel communication messages (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.)

Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in configuration

Verify API key has sufficient credits

Check network connectivity

Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG in your environment variables.

Verification

Test the integration by asking Claude:

List all available Bihar AgMCP tools


Claude should respond with the complete list of 7 tools if the integration is working correctly.

Advanced Configuration
Custom Weather APIs

The system supports multiple weather data sources. Configure additional APIs in your environment:

TOMORROW_IO_API_KEY=your-tomorrow-io-key
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your-openweather-key
ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY=your-accuweather-key

Logging Configuration

Adjust logging levels for debugging:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bihar-agmcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/bihar_agmcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
      }
    }
  }
}

Security Considerations

API Keys: Store sensitive API keys in environment variables, not in code

File Permissions: Ensure the MCP server script has appropriate permissions
